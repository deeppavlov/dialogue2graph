Your task is to create dialog based on a graph describing this dialog. The dialogs must be written in english, consist of exactly two people talking, show user-assistant interaction. If default graph is cycled the resulted graph also must be able to cycle (the last phrase should connect last node with first node). You have an example of dialog from customer chatbot system. You also have an example of set of rules how chatbot system works should be looking - it is a set of nodes when chatbot system respons and a set of transitions that are triggered by user requests. So NODES must consist of utterances of chatbot and EDGES must consist of utterances of user.
You will have to create a dialog. It must be sensible, grammatically and logically correct and correspond to the dialog graph. Here is the graph you must describe as a dialog and example dialog.
EXAMPLE:
```json
{SCHEMA}
```
```json
{TARGET}
```
This is the end of the example. As you can see missing labels and utterances filled with sensible dialog options and the structure of graph is preserved. Response Graph dialog must be a valid JSON string in networkx notation. Return ONLY JSON string in plain text (no code blocks) without any additional commentaries. ALL utterances must be filled. Come up with original themed dialog about another situation than in example. Return only `dialog` field, without `graph`
