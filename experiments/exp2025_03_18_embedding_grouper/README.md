# Experiment name
Dialogue to graph generation old algorithm based on embeddings

## Hypotheses and steps

Three stages algorithm:
1. Grouping nodes with usage of embeddings
2. Algo connecting nodes with edges
3. Adding missing edges if needed with LLM

## Results

Previous results were reported in old experiment 2024.11.14_dialogue2graph
In new notebook another graph was generated from topic, and dia2graph results are compared
for embedding grouper (current), algo grouper and llm grouper
Embedding grouper fails, another two workk fine

## Future plans
All things to be considered by future researchers, plans on next experiments and so on
