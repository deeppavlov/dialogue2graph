1,abstract purchase,False,"Invalid transition: The transition is invalid because the user's response 'I want X' should logically lead to the assistant asking if they want to add anything to X, not directly to 'Do you want to add anything else?' which implies the user has already added something to X.",True,"The dialog stays on the expected topic of abstract purchase.

4,coffee shop,False,"Invalid transition: The sequence is invalid because 'Latte tea' is not a typical response to 'Which tea would you like?' as 'Latte' is usually associated with coffee.
